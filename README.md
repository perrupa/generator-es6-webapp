## ES6

You can use FULL ES6 in this app. :facepunch: ES6-Webapp uses Babel under the hood to transpile ES6 to ES5, and then uses Browserify to package all your dependencies into one dandy file.

## LESS

LESS is awesome, and works right out of the box. Since all CSS is valid LESS, you can convert any existing CSS files straightaway.

**Why not SASS?** Sass is awesome, and for a Ruby-based project, it's the preprocessor to go with. However, ES6-Webapp is a Node-based app stack from the ground up, which means no Ruby dependency!

## Skeleton

Skeleton is a lightweight alternative to Bootstrap. It features clean markup and a light footprint.

**Why not Bootstrap?** Bootstrap is awesome, but the heavy markup results in a big Aspirin bill. Skeleton has almost no markup whatsoever, so if you decide you don't want it, there is nothing you need to remove but the CSS file itself.
